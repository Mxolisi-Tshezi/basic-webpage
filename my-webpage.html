            <h2>The Durban Central Post Office</h2>
            <img src="citypostoffice.PNG" class="imgSize">
            <p> This was the first town hall; the foundation stone was laid in 1883 and it was used as the Town Hall
                from 1885 to 1910 when the new Durban Town Hall, just across the road, came into use.
                here’s a plaque on the wall stating that “in this building the National Convention which led to the
                Union of South Africa held its first sittings from the 12th October 1908 to the 5th November 1908.”.
                Another historical event that this building is known for is that “following his escape from Pretoria
                in December 1899, Winston Churchill delivered a speech from the steps of the Town Hall to the
                excited citizens of Durban”</p>
